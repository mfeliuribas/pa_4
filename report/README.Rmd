## Assignment description
In this assignment, I learnt how to manage a "bigger" project with production data. Since these data were not collected by me, I started the assignment by taking a look at all README files in order to better understand the project. After, I started working on the Praat part: I normalized the scale peak intensity by using script 0 and created the needed textgrids with script 1. In this script, I had to change the participant ID (e.g., bi02, ne01, etc.) and replace the "Xs" with 45, which is the number of wav files for each participant. I then manually segmented each wav file and ran script 2 to extract the values (f1, f2, vot) and get the data. In order to make script 2 work, I had to add the participant ID and delete a #, because it affected that line code. The # sign is used to add comments, so Praat could not run that line, which was necessary for the loop to work. Afterwards, I tidied the data, got some descriptive stats, and created some plots in R Studio. 


## Hypothesis
The data come from 3 Spanish-English bilinguals and 3 English speaking learners of Spanish. Considering that Spanish and English are different in terms of VOT (VOT values for /p,t,k/ in Spanish are shorter ['short-lag'] compared to those of English ['long-lag']), I expect L2 learners to have longer VOT values than the Spanish-English bilinguals due to the influence of English, their L1.

  separate(
    col = fileID,
    into = c("participant", "word"),
    sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(
    group = case_when(
      startsWith(participant, "bi") ~ "bilinguals",
      startsWith(participant, "ne") ~ "L2ers")) %>%

You decide what is relevant (something related to your hypothesis). 
Think about where this file should be located in your project. 
What location makes most sense in terms of organization? 
How will you access the file (path) from this .Rmd file?
If you need help consider the following sources: 
  - Search 'Rmarkdown image' on google, stackoverflow, etc.
  - Search the 'knitr' package help files in RStudio
  - Search the internet for HTML code (not recommended, but it works)
  - Check the code from my class presentations (may or may not be helpful)

#| label: stats
# Conduct a simple statistical analysis here (optional)

```


# Conclusion

<!-- 
Revisit your hypotheses (refer to plots, figures, tables, statistical tests, 
etc.)

Reflect on the entire process. 
What did you enjoy? What did you hate? What did you learn? 
What would you do differently?

I predicted that English L2 learners of Spanish would have longer VOT values due to the influence from their L1, compared to Spanish-English bilinguals. Although no models were created and, thus, it cannot be assured that there is a significant difference between groups and that English and/or Spanish age of acquisition were significant predictors (I do not have these kind of data), the calculated means and the plots indicate that the VOT values of the participants in the L2 learners group were longer (mean = 34.25) than those in the bilingual group (mean = 21.01). Furthermore, Figures 1 and 2 suggest that there is more variability within the L2 learners group. Further analysis is needed to confirm these observations. 

**Some reflections:**
This last programming assignment was quite long. Although I would not say that it was very difficult, the Praat part was, indeed, tedious. I tried to use the function praatpicture() to include a couple of images from the wav files. However, it did not work (even though I tried for a while). Thanks to that, I learnt how to create and export pictures from Praat!
